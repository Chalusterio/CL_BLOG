                        <p>
                            Market sizing is an essential step in building any successful startup, and for PasaHEREro, it has been a cornerstone of our strategy. As an app designed to revolutionize commuting in Cagayan de Oro City, market sizing has allowed us to quantify the scale of our opportunity, validate our vision, and chart a clear path toward meaningful impact.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At its core, market sizing is the process of estimating the potential size and value of a market. It helps answer critical questions like how many people need what you’re offering, how much they are willing to pay, and what share of the market you can realistically capture. For PasaHEREro, this wasn’t just a numbers game—it was a way to understand our community’s commuting needs and the challenges that PUV drivers face daily.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Through market sizing, we confirmed that there is a significant demand for a streamlined commuting solution in Cagayan de Oro. Commuters often deal with long lines, unpredictable schedules, and cash-only transactions, making travel stressful and inconvenient. On the other side of the equation, PUV drivers face inefficiencies such as unfilled rides and limited visibility to potential passengers. These pain points revealed a clear gap that PasaHEREro is uniquely positioned to fill.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Breaking down the market involved analyzing two main groups: commuters and PUV drivers. For commuters, we estimated their travel habits, how frequently they use public transport, and their willingness to adopt a digital solution like ours. For drivers, we assessed their operational challenges, their familiarity with technology, and their openness to a platform that could increase their income and streamline ride management.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            From this analysis, we identified three key metrics: the Total Addressable Market (TAM), which represents the entire commuter population and PUV drivers in the city; the Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM), which narrowed the focus to those who actively need and can access our platform; and the Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM), which represents the realistic share of the market we aim to capture in the early years.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This process not only provided clarity but also influenced our strategic direction. Instead of attempting to solve every problem, we chose to focus on the most pressing needs: real-time updates, cashless transactions, and convenient booking options. Market sizing also guided our pricing strategy, ensuring affordability for commuters while supporting our operations. For instance, integrating e-wallets like GCash addressed the growing demand for cashless payments while improving the overall travel experience.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            One of the most significant outcomes of market sizing was its role in boosting stakeholder confidence. By presenting clear and realistic data, we were able to demonstrate the viability of PasaHEREro to investors, local government units, and PUV operators. It became evident that PasaHEREro isn’t just an idea—it’s a practical solution to real commuting challenges in Cagayan de Oro.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Looking forward, market sizing has also shaped our vision for scalability. While our initial focus is on Cagayan de Oro, the insights we’ve gained will guide future expansions to other regions with similar transportation challenges. The process highlighted areas where our platform can grow, such as introducing subscription plans for frequent riders or offering premium benefits for early adopters.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Reflecting on this journey, it’s clear that market sizing has been more than a strategic exercise—it’s been a mindset. It has allowed us to see beyond numbers, focusing instead on the people we aim to serve: the commuters who need convenience and the drivers who deserve better opportunities.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By grounding our vision in data and insights, PasaHEREro is building more than an app. We’re creating a solution that simplifies commuting, empowers communities, and fosters meaningful connections. Market sizing has provided the clarity and confidence to ensure that our platform not only meets the present needs of our users but also adapts and grows with them in the future.
